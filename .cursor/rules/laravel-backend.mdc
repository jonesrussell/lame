# Laravel Backend Development

## Architecture Patterns

- **Controllers**: Located in [app/Http/Controllers](mdc:app/Http/Controllers) - Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Models**: Located in [app/Models](mdc:app/Models) - Eloquent models with relationships and business logic
- **Services**: Use service classes for complex business logic, not controllers
- **Events**: Located in [app/Events](mdc:app/Events) - Domain events for decoupled communication
- **Listeners**: Located in [app/Listeners](mdc:app/Listeners) - Event handlers
- **Broadcasting**: Located in [app/Broadcasting](mdc:app/Broadcasting) - Real-time communication

## Key Laravel Features

- **Laravel Fortify**: Authentication scaffolding ([config/fortify.php](mdc:config/fortify.php))
- **Laravel Pulse**: Application monitoring ([config/pulse.php](mdc:config/pulse.php))
- **Laravel Reverb**: WebSocket server ([config/reverb.php](mdc:config/reverb.php))
- **Laravel Wayfinder**: Enhanced routing ([config/wayfinder.php](mdc:config/wayfinder.php))

## Database

- **Migrations**: Located in [database/migrations](mdc:database/migrations)
- **Seeders**: Located in [database/seeders](mdc:database/seeders)
- **Factories**: Located in [database/factories](mdc:database/factories)
- **Models**: Use Eloquent relationships, scopes, and accessors/mutators

## Testing

- **Pest PHP**: Located in [tests](mdc:tests) - Modern PHP testing framework
- **Feature Tests**: Test HTTP endpoints and full user workflows
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods
- **Database Tests**: Use RefreshDatabase trait for clean test state

## Code Standards

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use Laravel Pint for code formatting
- Use descriptive method and variable names
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use type hints and return types (PHP 8.2+)
